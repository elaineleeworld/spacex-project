ReactJS, Apollo, GraphQL, Axios, Express GraphQL server, third-party API
spin up a GraphQL server using Express, I use Axios and GraphQL to get data from SpaceX API.
server on localhost:5000/graphql
once I am able to get the launch data, I install create react app separate folder from server called client folder.
react app viewable on localhost:3000
in that folder i install Apollo which allows me to use React components to query GraphQL for data from the API I am using.
I use React Router for routes and pathing.
I use classnames for conditional classes.
MomentJS for date formatting.
Finally, I deploy the finished app to Heroku.
